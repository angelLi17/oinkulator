A pigified calculator for your entertainment. Do some arithmetic and HEAR the answer! Each series of oinks correlates with a number, and the output is in oinks.

<h1>How to deploy?</h1>

1. Chrome extension library:
2. Download the github files, head to chrome://settings, turn on developer mode, and click "load unpacked" then select the oinkulator folder you just downloaded. If the extension is toggled, you can access it as a regular chrome extension (the puzzle piece sign on the right side of your nav-bar).
